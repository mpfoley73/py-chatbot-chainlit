# Who's my Little Guy?

I'm you're little guy! The best friend you could ever have passed away in 2021, but his SI (super-schnoodle intelligence) is back as AI with the help of OpenAI and Chainlit.

This simple bot uses a system prompt that describes some of Chester's favorite tricks and activities. I created it by following along with [Bappy's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzfV0r2O_gk).
